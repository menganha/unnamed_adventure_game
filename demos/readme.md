# Demos and examples

This folder contains a series of examples used for the development and testing of many features of the game. The goal is here is twofold:

1. Test and develop features on a low scale environment. This allows not to focus much on the whole presentation and other components of the
   game, making it easier and faster to develop.
2. Shape the engine with real world examples. The main issue with developing the engine has been is overgeneralizing it without knowing what
   will be **actually** needed. This leads to an obfuscated and more complex system which is not desirable for the motivation and scale of
   this game.
