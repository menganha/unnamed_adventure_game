    Processes collisions with non-moving solid entities

    The system first resolves the collisions between with impenetrable hitbox and all movable hitboxes (independent of

    event.

    The reasoning is that after a "wall" collision entities normally needs a repositioning which can trigger further
    collision with entities which have been already tested negative for collision. This adds a layer of complexity
    as one has to deal with several collision checks
